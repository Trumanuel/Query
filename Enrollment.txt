1. Demonstrate how you add a new text book to the database and make this book be adopted
by some department.
insert into TextBook values
(123456, "Chandan The Autobiography", "Pearson", "Chandan");
insert into BookAdoption values
(001, 5, 123456);

2.Produce a list of text books (include Course #, Book-ISBN, Book-title) in the alphabetical
order for courses offered by the ‘CS’ department that use more than two books.
SELECT c.course,t.bookIsbn,t.book_title
     FROM Course c,BookAdoption ba,TextBook t
     WHERE c.course=ba.course
     AND ba.bookIsbn=t.bookIsbn
     AND c.dept='CS'
     AND 2<(
     SELECT COUNT(bookIsbn)
     FROM BookAdoption b
     WHERE c.course=b.course)
     ORDER BY t.book_title;

3.List any department that has all its adopted books published by a specific publisher.
SELECT DISTINCT c.dept
     FROM Course c
     WHERE c.dept IN
     ( SELECT c.dept
     FROM Course c,BookAdoption b,TextBook t
     WHERE c.course=b.course
     AND t.bookIsbn=b.bookIsbn
     AND t.publisher='PEARSON')
     AND c.dept NOT IN
     ( SELECT c.dept
     FROM Course c, BookAdoption b, TextBook t
     WHERE c.course=b.course
     AND t.bookIsbn=b.bookIsbn
     AND t.publisher!='PEARSON');

4.List the students who have scored maximum marks in ‘DBMS’ course.
select name from Student s, Enroll e, Course c
where s.regno=e.regno and e.course=c.course and c.cname="DBMS" and e.marks in (select max(marks) from Enroll e1, Course c1 where c1.cname="DBMS" and c1.course=e1.course);

5.Create a view to display all the courses opted by a student along with marks obtained.
create view CoursesOptedByStudent as
select c.cname, e.marks from Course c, Enroll e
where e.course=c.course and e.regno="01HF235";

select * from CoursesOptedByStudent;

6.Create a trigger that prevents a studentfrom enrolling in a course if the marks prerequisite
is less than 40.
DELIMITER //
create or replace trigger PreventEnrollment
before insert on Enroll
for each row
BEGIN
	IF (new.marks<40) THEN
		signal sqlstate '45000' set message_text='Marks below threshold';
	END IF;
END;//

DELIMITER ;

INSERT INTO Enroll VALUES
("01HF235", 002, 5, 5);
